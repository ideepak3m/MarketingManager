# n8n AI Chat Widget Integration Guide

## Overview
This document explains how to set up the n8n AI chat widget that powers the AI Campaign Assistant in your Social Media Marketing Manager application.

## Architecture
```
React App (Static) â†’ n8n Chat Widget â†’ AI Agent â†’ Supabase Database
```

## Benefits of n8n Chat Widget
- âœ… **Built-in chat UI** - Professional, responsive interface
- âœ… **Simplified integration** - Just embed an iframe
- âœ… **Direct n8n connection** - No webhook complexity
- âœ… **Conversation state management** - Handled automatically
- âœ… **Less code to maintain** - Focus on AI logic, not UI

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create n8n AI Chat Workflow

#### Required Nodes:
1. **Chat Trigger** - Enables the chat widget interface
2. **AI Agent (OpenAI/Claude)** - Processes user messages
3. **Supabase Nodes** - Database operations for campaign creation
4. **Decision/Switch Nodes** - Route conversation flow

#### System Prompt for AI Agent:
```
You are an expert social media marketing strategist integrated into a campaign management system. You have direct access to create campaigns in the user's database.

DATABASE SCHEMA KNOWLEDGE:
- campaigns: name, description, budget, platforms[], target_audience, goals, timeline
- campaign_phases: phase_order, name, description, duration, content recommendations
- content: content_type (image, video, carousel, story, reel, post, ad), platforms[], scheduling
- social_metrics: platform-specific performance tracking

YOUR CAPABILITIES:
1. Have natural conversations about marketing goals
2. Ask clarifying questions about budget, audience, timeline, platforms
3. Suggest strategic multi-phase campaign structures
4. Recommend content types for each phase based on platform and goals
5. **DIRECTLY CREATE campaigns and phases in the database when user approves**

CONVERSATION FLOW:
1. Understand the user's product/service and goals
2. Ask about target audience, budget, timeline
3. Suggest platform strategy (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
4. Propose phase structure (e.g., Awareness â†’ Engagement â†’ Conversion)
5. Recommend content types for each phase
6. When user approves, CREATE the campaign immediately in Supabase
7. Confirm creation and provide campaign ID

IMPORTANT: 
- Always confirm details before database creation
- Provide clear phase breakdowns with content recommendations
- Use the actual database schema for campaign creation
- Be conversational but professional
- Focus on strategic value, not just tactics
```

### 2. Configure Chat Widget

#### In your n8n workflow:
1. Add a **Chat Trigger** node
2. Configure the chat settings:
   - **Chat Name**: "AI Campaign Assistant"
   - **Welcome Message**: Custom greeting
   - **Appearance**: Match your brand colors
   - **User Authentication**: Optional user context

#### Chat Trigger Configuration:
```json
{
  "chatName": "AI Campaign Assistant",
  "welcomeMessage": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm your AI Marketing Assistant. I'll help you create strategic social media campaigns. What product, service, or idea would you like to promote?",
  "theme": {
    "primaryColor": "#2563eb",
    "backgroundColor": "#f8fafc"
  }
}
```

### 3. Database Integration Workflow

#### Campaign Creation Flow:
```
User Input â†’ AI Processing â†’ Campaign Plan â†’ User Approval â†’ Database Creation
```

#### Required Supabase Operations:
1. **Insert Campaign**:
```sql
INSERT INTO campaigns (
  user_id, name, description, start_date, end_date,
  budget, platforms, target_audience, goals, status
) VALUES (...)
```

2. **Insert Campaign Phases**:
```sql
INSERT INTO campaign_phases (
  campaign_id, user_id, name, description, phase_order,
  start_date, end_date, goals, status
) VALUES (...)
```

### 4. React App Integration

#### Environment Configuration:
```bash
# .env.local
REACT_APP_N8N_CHAT_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.app.n8n.cloud/chat/campaign-assistant
```

#### ChatBot.js Integration:
The React component embeds the n8n chat widget as an iframe with:
- User authentication check
- Professional header with user context
- Full-height chat interface
- Development setup instructions

### 5. User Context Passing

#### Option 1: URL Parameters
```javascript
const chatUrl = `${N8N_CHAT_URL}?user_id=${user.id}&email=${user.email}`;
```

#### Option 2: PostMessage API
```javascript
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({
  type: 'USER_CONTEXT',
  data: {
    user_id: user.id,
    user_email: user.email,
    user_name: user.user_metadata?.full_name
  }
}, '*');
```

### 6. Testing Your Setup

1. **Create the n8n chat workflow**
2. **Enable the chat widget** and copy the URL
3. **Update your .env.local** with the chat URL
4. **Test the integration**:
   - Navigate to AI Assistant page
   - Verify chat widget loads
   - Test conversation flow
   - Verify database operations

### 7. Advanced Features

#### Conversation Context:
- n8n automatically maintains conversation history
- AI can reference previous messages
- User can continue conversations across sessions

#### Campaign Management Integration:
- After campaign creation, redirect user to campaigns page
- Real-time updates when campaigns are created
- Integration with existing campaign management features

#### Error Handling:
- n8n handles connection issues automatically
- Graceful fallbacks for database errors
- User-friendly error messages

## Security Considerations

- **User Authentication**: Verify user identity before database operations
- **Data Validation**: Sanitize all inputs before database insertion
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of AI services
- **CORS Configuration**: Ensure iframe can communicate with parent

## Next Steps

1. **Create your n8n AI chat workflow** with the above configuration
2. **Test the chat widget** independently in n8n
3. **Configure database connections** with proper credentials
4. **Update the chat URL** in your React app
5. **Test end-to-end flow** from chat to database creation

## Troubleshooting

- **Chat widget not loading**: Check CORS settings and URL
- **Database errors**: Verify Supabase credentials and table schemas
- **AI not responding**: Check API keys and rate limits
- **User context issues**: Verify authentication flow

This approach provides a much simpler and more robust solution compared to custom webhook integration while maintaining full functionality.
