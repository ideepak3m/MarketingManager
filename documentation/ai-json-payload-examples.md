# AI JSON Payload Examples# AI-Generated JSON Payload Examples for Supabase



This document provides examples of JSON payloads generated by Nova AI based on the actual n8n workflow implementation.## Overview

When the AI completes the conversation and the user approves the campaign plan, the AI should generate a structured JSON payload that can be directly inserted into your Supabase database.

## Complete Example: Product Launch Campaign

## Database Structure Reminder

This example shows the full JSON structure that Nova generates for a typical product launch campaign:- `campaigns` table: Main campaign container

- `campaign_phases` table: Individual phases within each campaign

```json- Both tables link via `campaign_id`
